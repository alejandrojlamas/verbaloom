"""
API key pool with throttle tracking and round-robin rotation.

Used by cloud LLM providers to support multiple API keys for the same provider.
On HTTP 429, the failing key is marked throttled and the next available key is
selected on the next request — failover happens without sleeping when possible.

Compatibility:
    - A pool with a single key behaves identically to today's single-key string.
    - All mutating operations are async-safe via asyncio.Lock so the same pool
      can be shared across coroutines (forward compatibility with parallel
      dispatch).
